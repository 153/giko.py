How to get IRC <---> Gikopoi relay working:

1. Download and compile ii, the suckless IRC client
   https://tools.suckless.org/ii/

2. Connect ii to an IRC network and channel. This creates a
   directory and files somewhere like
        ./networkname/channelname/in
        ./networkname/channelname/out
   If you don't know how to do that, after you compile ii,
   drop the binary in giko.py/irc/ , then modify and run
   the included ./irc/ircrelay.sh script -- replace SOMEBOTNAME
   and IRC.SOMEIRCNETWORK.COM with what you want to call
   your IRC bot and what network you want it to connect to.
   After it connects to your network, write "/j #somechannel"
   to ./networkname/in to join that channel.

   Wait until ii connects to your network and joins it before
   running giko.py .

3. The way ii works, is: new messages written to "in" get
   sent to IRC by ii ; ii also adds new lines to "out" when
   it receives messages from the IRC channel (message sent,
   user joins, blah blah)

   .... make sure that the giko.py script can read "out"
   and write to the "in" file or you won't get any bridge working

4. Configure ircrelay.py with the locations of ii's channel
   in and channel out files and the name of your ii user;
   ircrelay handles sending and loading messages automagically.

5. In giko.py , modify ircroom to be a valid gikopoi room ID.
   Now, if you launch your giko.py with everything configured
   correctly, and you have it join your ircroom, the relay should
   work!
