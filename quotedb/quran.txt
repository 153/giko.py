(41:8) Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds – for them is a reward uninterrupted. 
(13:28) Indeed, those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured. 
(17:29) And do not let your hand be tied [like a miser] to your neck or extend it completely and thereby become blamed and insolvent. 
(51:55) And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers. 
(4:36) Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful. 
(13:6) And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing. 
(2:195) And spend in the way of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction. 
(2:205) Indeed, Allah does not like corruption. 
(28:77) And seek the home of the Hereafter with what Allah has given you but do not forget your share of the world. 
(93:8) And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient. 
(16:116) And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, 'This is lawful and this is unlawful,' to invent falsehood about Allah.

(2:123) And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all. 
(16:53) And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah. 
(4:26) Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. 
(30:60) So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. 
(62:11) And Allah is the best of providers. 
(65:3) And whoever relies upon Allah – then He is sufficient for him. 
(7:180) And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. 
(13:11) Indeed, Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. 
(4:124) And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer – those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged. 
(3:175) And do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are [indeed] believers. 
(18:110) So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord – let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.
